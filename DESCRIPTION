Description: An implementation of robust exponential smoothing models that
    produce probabilistic forecasts using sample paths. Handling of anomalies is
    integrated into a custom maximum-a-posteriori fitting procedure that exposes
    most aspects of the model to the user. Initial states can be provided to
    start training from previous fits, transfer seasonality from other time
    series. User-defined parameter grids and prior distributions restrict the
    set of reasonable model choices to robust ones.
