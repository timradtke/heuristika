#' Forecast by drawing sample paths from a fitted object
#'
#' Generate a forecast in the form of `n` sample paths for the forecast horizon
#' `h` based on the fitted model `object`.
#'
#' The forecasts of a `tulip` model are natively represented by sample paths.
#' Instead of providing a single point forecast, or marginal quantiles, possible
#' future outcomes are summarized through samples from the joint distribution
#' across future horizons. These samples can be summarized down to marginal
#' quantiles, but they also contain the dependency between future horizons
#' that is commonly lost by forecast frameworks that solely store marginal
#' quantile forecasts.
#'
#' Depending on the chosen `family`, the samples are either based on a
#' distribution that is fitted against the model's residuals during the fitting
#' procedure; or they can be based directly on bootstrapped residuals if
#' the `family` of the `tulip` object is overwritten to be `bootstrap`. In the
#' latter case, the forecast distribution can represent asymmetries that were
#' observed in the input data. You might *not* want to use `bootstrap` when the
#' input time series is very short. In such cases, a parametric assumption can
#' help with more reasonable behavior of the error component.
#'
#' As for all exponential smoothing models, the one-step-ahead sample is fed
#' back into the model to update the state components, before the two-step-ahead
#' forecast sample is drawn given the updated state components. Through this
#' mechanism, the temporal dependencies between samples of the same sample path
#' are maintained. For example, if the initial sample is higher than average,
#' the level and trend components of the model might update to be larger, thus
#' consequently increasing chances that the next sample is again high (compared
#' to the most recently observed training observation and level).
#'
#' If the model is able to represent the input data well, then sample paths look
#' like reasonable future continuations of the input series. Averaging across
#' sample paths one can derive quantiles of the forecast distribution.
#'
#' Importantly, because the sample paths maintain the temporal dependencies,
#' one can also aggregate the forecasts *across forecast horizons* which is not
#' possible when only quantiles are returned by a model. The ability to
#' summarize arbitrary aggregates can be helpful for optimization problems that
#' use the forecast as input.
#'
#' The returned value is a matrix of dimensions `h` times `n`. Each of the `n`
#' columns represents one sample path and is a random draw from the
#' `h`-dimensional forecast distribution. See also examples below.
#'
#' Use the `postprocess_sample` argument to hook into the sampling process of
#' the `predict()` method. Provide a function that is applied on the current
#' j-step-ahead vector of samples *before* it is fed back into the model, before
#' the states are updated given those samples. This allows you to adjust the
#' data generating process--for example, to enforce non-negative count samples--
#' while doing so before the state components (level, trend, seasonality) of the
#' model are updated given the most recent sample. This can prevent the model's
#' level from drifting to zero, for example, because samples never became
#' less than zero, thus affecting subsequent samples to drift even further below
#' zero, and so on. Generated samples stay similar to the input data, allowing
#' the forecast to stay similar to the input data.
#'
#' @param object The fitted model object returned by [tulip::tulip()] of class
#'     `tulip`.
#' @param h The forecast horizon as integer number of periods.
#' @param n The integer number of sample paths to draw from the forecast
#'     distribution.
#' @param remove_anomalies Logical (default `TRUE`); during prediction, some
#'   generated samples can have the characteristics of anomalies; as such, they
#'   can be identified and interpolated to not adversely affect the state
#'   updates when predicting multiple horizos, similar to `remove_anomalies` in
#'   [tulip::tulip()]. The interpolated values are only used to fit the states.
#'   The returned sample paths will still contain the anomalous samples.
#'   Which samples are anomalous is determined based on the residuals from the
#'   original model fit.
#' @param postprocess_sample A function that is applied on a numeric vector of
#'     drawn samples for a single step-ahead before the samples are used to
#'     update the state of the model, and before outliers are removed
#'     (if applicable). By default equal to `identity()`, but could also
#'     be something like `function(x) pmax(x, 0)` to enforce a lower bound of 0,
#'     or any other transformation of interest. This works best with
#'     `family = "bootstrap"` when the applied transformation represents a
#'     feature of the data generating process that is non-Gaussian.
#'     Note that this can cause arbitrary errors caused by the author of the
#'     function provided to `postprocess_sample`.
